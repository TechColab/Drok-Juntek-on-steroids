Goal:
THT
No bigger than original board
Economise where possible
Include serial & other connector - just in case.

SoFar:
Board outline is approx 80% of the original
All done first draft.
Options for connection to GNDA, GNDD or both.

ToDo:
Check.
Check size of TFT board when over-laid
Check values of components - as per schematic or prototype diag?
Confirm THT vs SMT
